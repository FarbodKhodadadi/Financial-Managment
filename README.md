# Finanicial-Managment
This is the first project from AP course at University of Tehran.
You can find more information about this from the description file.

I used diffrent data structures and iterators to calculate and store expenses for each category and sub-category.

Few specific command lines are used to show and manage these expenses which is why this project is user-friendly.
